Project: Designer of applications

Here is an intermediate stage of the project without database (but into database is presented core business logic on the application).

This is a lot of the modular Maven project:

  for the first version of Front-End - main of part on the Angular2+TypeScript;

  for Back-End (full version) - Java8, Spring Data (JPA, Rest);

  for the second version of Front-End (full version) - Backbone+Dust+AJAX+JQuery. 

The goal is to give the opportunity to lead the development UI directly in the application (without IDE) into the browser.

For example, Dev is using let's say a tablet to develop UI part of SPA on the Angular2 + TypeScript + Bootstrap or Backbone + Dust + AJAX + JQuery staying anywhere.

In project on the Angular2 used 10 Component, that will provide to work any count virtual Component + create of dynamic a Template used HTML pieces or directives of ngFor, ngIf

Technologies: Java, Spring Data (JPA, Rest), Spring MVC, JS, Backbone+Dust+AJAX+JQuery or Angular2+TypeScript, FireBird 2.5 (InterBase)

The project is done.
